                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p1>A pet store or pet shop is a retail business which sells different kinds of animals
                        to the public. A variety of animal supplies and pet accessories are also sold in pet shops.
                        The products sold include: food, treats, toys, collars, leashes, cat litter, cages and
                        aquariums. Some pet stores provide engraving services for pet tags, which have the
                        ownerâ€™s contact information in case the pet gets lost.</p1>
                    <p1>In the USA and Canada, pet shops often offer both hygienic care (such as pet cleaning)
                        and esthetic services (such as cat and dog grooming). Grooming is the process by which a
                        dog or cats's physical appearance is enhanced and kept according to breed standards for
                        competitive breed showing, for other types of competition, like creative grooming or pet
                        tuning contests, or just to their owners taste. Some pet stores also provide tips on training
                        and behaviour, as well as advice on pet nutrition..</p1><br>
